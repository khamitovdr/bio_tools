# Experiment

This module provides the class for creating and running biological experiments. An experiment is a sequence of actions including:

- Actions (e.g. pump liquid)
- Measurements (e.g. measure optical density)
- Waiting (wait for a certain amount of time)

After setting up an experiment, you can run it and the BioExperiment Suite will execute the actions in the order you specified. Then you can analyze the results.
